    <h3>Background</h3>
    I am a masters student in management science and engineering at Stanford University, with previous degrees in physics and operations research from the University of Melbourne. Prior to Stanford, I worked for four years in data science and analytics, including two years as a consultant at Accenture and just over a year as a strategy analyst at a legal tech startup. I have a strong technical background (in math, data and programming), consulting skills (in communication, problem-solving, commercial acumen and teamwork), and a passion to do well in all that I set out to do.

    <h3>Career Goals</h3>
    I seek to advance the operations research industry across high impact problems, both operationally as an industry leader, and in contributing to its professional literature as a thought leader. I am fascinated by the science of decision making, especially in dynamic contexts, and seek to apply operations research, strategy and data science toward industrial-scale applications. I am particularly interested in the tech, airline, logistics, supply chain and transportation industries because of their complex processes, potential for improvement and societal impact.
