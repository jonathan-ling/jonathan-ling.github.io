        <h3>Background</h3>
        I am a master's student in management science and engineering at Stanford University, with previous degrees in physics and operations research from the University of Melbourne. Prior to Stanford, I worked for four years in data science and analytics, including 1.5 years as a strategy analyst at a legal tech startup followed by 2 years as a consultant at Accenture. I have a strong technical background (in math, data and programming), consulting skills (in communication, problem-solving, commercial acumen and teamwork), and a passion to do well in all I do.

        <h3>Career Goals</h3>
         I seek to contribute to the development of industries across high impact problems, through advances in tools such as strategic thinking and operations research. I am fascinated by the science of decision making, especially in dynamic contexts, and seek to apply operations research, strategy and data science toward industrial-scale applications. I am particularly interested in the tech, airline, logistics, supply chain and transportation industries because of their complex processes, potential for improvement and societal impact.
