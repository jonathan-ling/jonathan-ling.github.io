         I am a consultant at McKinsey & Company, a strategy consulting firm, which helps organizations solve high-impact problems. I have always loved learning and enjoy the diversity of experiences it brings. My academic background is in management science, physics and operations research - "the science of decision making". A mathematician at heart, I first learnt about the very interesting real-world applications of math while working at a legal tech startup and have since been pursuing it in a strategic context. Mostly recently, I have completed a graduate degree in Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University, which has equipped me to tackle business problems with a scientific approach.

         From these experiences, I seek to contribute to the development of public sector domains and private sector industries, through tools such as strategy and decision science, with skills from my background in math, consulting, strategy and entrepreneurship. I'm fascinated by decision-making in large, complex operations, and am passionate to bring about positive change in society through advances in operational disciplines, especially in supply chain, logistics, transport and manufacturing. In this website, you will find my portfolio of past projects from these areas, as well as an eclectic collection of things I like writing about to share.
