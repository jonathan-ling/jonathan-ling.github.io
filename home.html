         I am a consultant at McKinsey, with an academic background in management science, physics and operations research. A mathematician at heart, I first learnt about the very interesting real-world applications of math, particularly in business, while working at a legal tech startup, and have since been pursuing it in a strategic context. Mostly recently, I have completed a graduate degree in Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University, which has equipped me to tackle business problems with a scientific approach.
         <br><br>
         From these experiences, I seek to contribute to the development of industries, through tools such as strategic thinking, data science and operations research, with skills from my background in math, consulting, strategy and entrepreneurship. In this website, you will find my portfolio of past projects from these areas, as well as an eclectic collection of things I like writing about to share.
