Modern society runs on increasingly complex systems and processes, such as the mass transportation of people and goods, healthcare delivery, energy and water distribution, and emergency management - all requiring large-scale operational coordination. Data, optimization and strategic thinking are key to improving societal efficiency in the way the world works and lives.
<br><br>
I seek to make practical advances in the field of operations research, 'the science of decision making', which is used to optimize large-scale systems and processes, with skills from my background in math, data science, consulting, strategy and entrepreneurship.

Thanks for stopping by!
