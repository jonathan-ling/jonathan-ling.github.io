         With an academic background in physics and math, I had my first taste of really interesting problems from the world of business and entrepreneurship from my time at LegalVision, a legal tech startup. I found powerful solutions from applying the hard sciences to commercial problems, and went on to develop skills in data science â€” the intersection of math, business problem-solving and computer science.
         <br><br>
         I later transitioned to Accenture as a Data Science Consultant and thoroughly enjoyed the constant challenge of working on tough business problems across not just one, but multiple industries, while applying my technical skillset to, satisfyingly, make a real world impact.
         <br><br>
         From these experiences, I seek to contribute to the development of industries, through tools such as strategic thinking, data science and operations research, with skills from my background in math, consulting, strategy and entrepreneurship.
